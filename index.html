            Ada lovelace is often referred to as the first programmer, 
            but some historians disagree and say that it was Charles Babbage. 
            Even if she wasn't the first programmer, what she achieved was still remarkable, 
            especially for a woman during the time that she was alive, and many people have been inspired by her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her story starts on December 10th, 1815. Ada Lovelace was born, 
            Augusta Ada Byron, to Lord and Lady Byron. Lord Byron was disappointed about having a daughter 
            instead of a son, and five weeks after Ada's birth, he sent her and her mother away. 
            Her mother would be the one to raise her and create her love of mathemetics. 
            Due to the way that Lord Byron acted and the amount of scandals he created, Ada's mother was worried that 
            she would take after him, so she tried to stop it from happening before it could even begin. 
            She decided to raise Ada with logic, science, and mathematics instead of poetry and romanticism.

          <p>
            During her years of study, Ada had multiple tutors, one of which she nearly ran away with. 
            It was after this that Mary Somerville was hired to become Ada's tutor, and unlike others before her, 
            she stuck around. Not only was she Ada's tutor, she quickly became her friend as well as her mentor. 
            In fact it was her that ended up introducing Ada Lovelace to Charles Babbage. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A month after meeting Charles Babbage, Ada was invited to see the prototype for his difference engine, 
            and she became fascinated. Impressed by her intelligence, Charles Babbage was quick to become friends with, 
            and mentor, Ada. She knew so much about his designs and machines, that she volunteered to translate an Italian 
            article on the analytical machine into English. She had apended notes, ones that ended up being even longer than 
            the original article. Her notes explained how to use the analytical machine, and even included an algorithm, 
            which many people consider to be the first program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether or not she truly was the first programmer, Ada Lovelace inspired many people to go into the field of STEM. 
            She lived an extrodinary, but short life. She lived until the age of 36, when she passed away from uterine cancer.
